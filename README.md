<h3>Travel Time Estimation to Vancouver General Hospital</h3>

Maps are used daily for navigation purposes for general users, but it can also be used for analysis purposes by researchers and planners to assess accessibility. Health care accessibility is a significant topic of research and is a crucial part in city planning and policy-making; it is of utmost importance for hospitals and health care facilities to be built in areas to serve the population of a city with maximum efficiency. To contribute to this topic of research, I aimed to find out accessibility to Vancouver General Hospital, since it is the largest hospital serving the residents of Vancouver. I have decided to create an isochrone map with the interactivity feature of buttons which users can press to estimate accessibility via three different modes of transporation for three different time intervals. The target audience for this map can be planners for research purposes, or patients for navigation and travel time estimation purposes. 

Users can select from three modes of travel: walking, cycling, or driving. Then they an decide the maximum time they would like to allocate to travel: 10, 20, 30 minutes. This interactivity allows users to see the boundary within which they can get to the hospital within a set time. For example, a patient who does not have access to a vehicle, and can only walk for maximum 20 minutes, can use this map to see whether their location falls within the boundary where they can reach VGH within 20 minutes. The basemap used for this project is designed by Mapbox Studio for navigation purposes, therefore the roads and highways are visible for easier use; and the opacity of the isochrone boundary is low enough for users to be able to locate their starting point/residental location within the isochrone. 

A step further for this map would be to include all hospital locations within the City of Vancouver to allow users to compare locations for best travel time. Furthermore, the scale of the project can be expanded to include all of Metro Vancouver, as opposed to just the City of Vancouver.
